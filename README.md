![hero page](https://github.com/anav5704/gamers-hub/blob/main/docs/gamers-hub.png)

This is a blog website for gamers that features the latest news articles on various games. It is a simple site having just the main page and individual blog pages. Images may look pixelated due to Astros built-in image compressing, which is not too bad as blog sites deal with large amounts of images at scale. Astro view transitions also allow for fade transitions between pages for a smooth experience.
