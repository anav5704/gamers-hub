This is a blog website for gamers which features latest news articles on various games. It is a simple site having just the main page and individual blog pages. Images may look pixelated due to Astros build in image compressing, which is not too bad as blog sites deal with large amounts of images at scale. Astro view transitions also allow for fade transitions between pages for a smooth exprience.
